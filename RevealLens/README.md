	1.	What worked well in this project?
The project setup with Vite made it easy to start, providing a clean and efficient React template. Integrating React Router for seamless page navigation was straightforward. The implementation of file upload, preview functionality, and EXIF metadata extraction worked smoothly. Using simulated AI analysis allowed for quick testing without external dependencies, and the CSS styling improved the overall presentation. The component-based structure also made the code maintainable and scalable, resulting in a robust foundation for further development and enhancements.

	2.	What didn’t work well?
There were challenges integrating third-party APIs directly from the client, leading to security and CORS issues. Parsing and converting EXIF GPS data into a human-readable format was more complex than anticipated. Additionally, handling edge cases for metadata extraction required extra debugging. The setup for environment variables and API key configurations sometimes led to confusion, especially when switching between simulated and real API calls. Overall, these issues demanded additional time to troubleshoot and streamline, impacting the initial development pace.

	3.	What changes would you make now that it’s deployed?
One major change would be refactoring API calls to run through a secure backend, such as Firebase Cloud Functions, to protect API keys and enhance security. I would also improve error handling and optimize image processing for better performance. Refining the UI based on user feedback, along with enhancing code modularity, would be prioritized. These changes would not only secure the application further but also pave the way for smoother integration of additional features and long-term maintainability.

	4.	What would you improve and/or add to this project now that it’s deployed?
To further enhance the project, I would integrate real-time analytics and automated logging to monitor performance and user interactions. Adding responsive design improvements and more interactive UI elements, such as image editing tools or additional data visualizations, would boost usability. Implementing comprehensive automated testing and a CI/CD pipeline would ensure consistent quality and faster iterations. These enhancements would provide deeper insights into user behavior and make the application more robust and scalable for future feature additions.
